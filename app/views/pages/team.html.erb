    </div>
  		<p style="text-align: center">Liz founded FacePlant to do her small part to right the gender imbalance that plagues today's technological problem solving. When the people who hold the keys to innovation are all well-off, white, urban men they tend to solve the problems of well-off, white, urban men. Cataloguing and recommending beauty products for women (and men!) who don't have time for magazines and trials but want only the best is a thin slice of the wedge, but it's a start. Former lives include public policy analyst, researcher, reporter, student, farmer and government wonk. <a href="https://twitter.com/lizsgross" target="_blank">@lizsgross</a> </p>
